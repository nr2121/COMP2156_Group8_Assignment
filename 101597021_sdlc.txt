Why does DevOps matter?

DevOps matters in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) because it transforms the traditional, often siloed, development process into a faster, more reliable, and collaborative, continuous loop. It bridges the gap between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams, enabling the rapid, automated delivery of high-quality software. 

DevOps improves the software development lifecycle by integrating development and operations teams, automating workflows, and enabling continuous integration and delivery. This results in faster development cycles, fewer bugs, smoother deployments, and quicker feedback loops, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and quality of software delivery.Added a title
