George Brown College is a public college located in Toronto, Canada.
It offers a wide range of courses that lead to a diploma, certificate or degree.
The college focuses on hands on learning and career readiness.
I have been here for 4 semesters so far and find it great.
I feel as though I am being prepared for my future career rather than not learning anything about my future job.
Compared to prior education I definitely feel more prepared than I have ever been in the past.
